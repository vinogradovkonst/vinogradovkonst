### Hey ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a General Partner at venture firm Runa Capital, where I focus on investing in early-stage startups building OSS, dev-focused, and infrastructure software. My favorite areas of next-gen infra include data, AI/ML, cloud, security, observability, and enterprise suites (like CRM and ERP). As a VC and a philanthropist, I am strongly interested in Open Source, and I take it seriously.

Some open source startups we invested in:

* [Nginx]([url](https://github.com/nginx/nginx)), the most popular web server in the world (exited in 2019)
* [MariaDB]([url](https://github.com/MariaDB/server)), relational database founded by MySQl's creator (exited in 2024)
* [Twenty]([url](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty)), next-gen CRM platform, open-source alternative to Salesforce ([thesis]([url](https://kvinogradov.com/twenty/)))
* [Keep]([url](https://github.com/keephq/keep)), next-gen alert management and AIOps platform for enterprises ([thesis]([url](https://kvinogradov.com/keep/)))
* [OpenReplay]([url](https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay/)), session replay and product analytics suite
* [PandasAI]([url](https://github.com/Sinaptik-AI/pandas-ai)), platform to query your data in natural language
* [Evidently]([url](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently)), the most popular observability framework for ML models

Since 2020, I have been publishing the [Runa Open Source Startup (ROSS) Index]([url](https://runacap.com/ross-index/)), where we highlight the top 20 trending open source startups (by GitHub star growth) every quarter.
