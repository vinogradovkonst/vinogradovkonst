### Hey 👋 

I am an active angel investor specializing in open source, AI, and infrastructure software. 

Before that, I was a General Partner at Runa Capital, a VC firm which backed more than 100 B2B software and deep tech startups, including such open source companies as [N8N](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), [MariaDB](https://github.com/MariaDB/server), and [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx). Some of my OSS-related investments done personally or as a partner at Runa:

* [Mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra): Leading open source TypeScript AI agent framework
* [White Circle](https://github.com/whitecircle-ai): AI guardrails and red-teaming platform for businesses (especially, AI code gen!)
* [Twenty](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty): Leading open source CRM platform, an alternative to Salesforce
* [Higgsfield](https://github.com/higgsfield-ai/higgsfield): AI video and image generation models and apps
* [Keep](https://github.com/keephq/keep): Open source alert management and AIOps platform (acquired by Elastic)
* [Sidekick](http://meetsidekick.com): Work-focused browser based on [Chromium](https://github.com/chromium/chromium) (acquired by Perplexity)
* [OpenReplay](https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay/): Open source session replay and product analytics suite
* [Pandas AI](https://github.com/Sinaptik-AI/pandas-ai): Open source businss intelligence platform to query data in natural language
* [Evidently AI](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently): Leading open source observability framework for AI/ML models

As a VC and a philanthropist, I am deeply interested in Open Source, and I take it seriously. Besides investing, there are several related projects that I ideated and have built over the years, including:

* [Open Source Endowment](https://github.com/osendowment) (2025-now): The world's first endowment dedicated to OSS and enabling a new sustainable funding source for open source maintainers. It is a community nonprofit, supported by 50+ founders, OSS creators, developers, etc.

* [ROSS Index](https://github.com/RunaCapital/ROSS-Index) (2020-2025): A quarterly index of the top 20 trending open source startups, now maintained by Runa Capital.
