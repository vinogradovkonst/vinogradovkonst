### Hey ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a General Partner at venture firm Runa Capital, where I focus on investing in early-stage startups building OSS, dev-focused, and infrastructure software. My favorite areas of next-gen infra include data, AI/ML, cloud, security, observability, and enterprise suites (like CRM and ERP). Some open source startups we invested in:

* [N8N](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), workflow automation platform with native AI capabilities
* [Mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra), the leading TypeScript AI agent framework ([thesis](https://kvinogradov.com/mastra/)
* [Twenty](https://github.com/twentyhq/twenty), next-gen CRM platform, open-source alternative to Salesforce ([thesis](https://kvinogradov.com/twenty/))
* [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx), the most popular web server in the world (exited in 2019)
* [MariaDB](https://github.com/MariaDB/server), relational database founded by MySQL's creator (exited in 2024)
* [Keep](https://github.com/keephq/keep), next-gen alert management and AIOps platform for enterprises ([thesis](https://kvinogradov.com/keep/), exited in 2025)
* [OpenReplay](https://github.com/openreplay/openreplay/), session replay and product analytics suite
* [Pandas AI](https://github.com/Sinaptik-AI/pandas-ai), platform to query your data in natural language
* [Evidently AI](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently), the most popular observability framework for ML models

Since 2020, I have been publishing the [Runa Open Source Startup (ROSS) Index](https://github.com/RunaCapital/ROSS-Index), where we highlight the top 20 trending open source startups (by GitHub star growth) every quarter. Also, we created and have been maintaining an awesome list of [open-source alternatives to the most popular SaaS](https://github.com/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives) <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives?style=social"/>

As a VC and a philanthropist, I am strongly interested in Open Source, and I take it seriously.
