### I am a General Partner at [Runa Capital](https://runacap.com), who focuses on open source and AI/ML

We funded many open-source and developer-focused startups including [Nginx](https://nginx.com), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com), [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) and [N8N](https://n8n.io). Usually Runa Capital invests $1-10M at early stages in enteprise software, deep tech (open source, machine intelligence, quantum computing, etc) and software solutions for regulated industries (fintech, edutech, digital health).

Are you building an open-source startup? Please tell me more via [email](mailto:kv@runacap.com)!
