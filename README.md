### I am Principal at a global venture capital firm Runa Capital

🏢 We funded many open-source and developer-focused startups including [Nginx](https://nginx.com), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com), [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) and [N8N](https://n8n.io). Usually Runa Capital invests $1-10M at early stages in enteprise software, deep tech (open source, machine intelligence, quantum computing, etc) and software solutions for regulated industries (fintech, edutech, digital health).
